#LED list wired up to the raspPI
#name		channel	voltage
# duty cycles are calculated from ratio of voltage here to vsupply in LEDConfig
LED385L         11      4.0  # sometimes saturates at 100% duty cycle
LEDW            8       5.0
LEDRGBAnnode	12	3.0   # not connected to PWM for open drain
LEDR		13	5.0
LEDB		14	5.0
LEDG		15	5.0
# Note: the PMW output to the 275nm LEDs is upscaled from 5V to 12V line voltage,
# while maintaining the same duty cycle. So the actual voltage applied to the LEDs
# is the voltage given here multiplied by (12/5).
LED275J_A       0       5.0   # 4.2 for no clipping in pure
LED275J_B       10      5.0
