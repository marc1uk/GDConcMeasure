# note we cannot enable two instances of LoadOldFiles or MarcusAnalyse in one ToolChain.
# this is because LoadOldFiles sets the 'Analyse <LED>' flag in the datamodel,
# which would be overriden by a second instance.
# Similarly MarcusAnalysis sets things into the CStore and triggers SaveToDB,
# and some CStore contents would be overridden by a second MarcusAnalyse instance.
# And two SaveToDB tools would result in duplicate entries, because they do not
# clear the NewMarcusAnalysis flag in the CStore... perhaps they could if we
# can guarantee no other downstream tools want to take action on new analysis results.
